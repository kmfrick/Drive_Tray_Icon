# Drive\_Tray\_Icon

Tray icon with push/pull support for [drive](https://github.com/odeke-em/drive).

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04. The drive binary has to be called `drive-google` and a file has to exist under `~/.config/drive_google_tray.yaml` with a `drive_dir` property containing your Drive path.

Requires drive, pygobject and pyyaml.
